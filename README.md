### Overview

Data Science and Big Data Analytics are exciting new areas that combine scientific inquiry, statistical knowledge, substantive expertise, and computer programming. One of the main challenges for businesses and policy makers when using big data is to find people with the appropriate skills. Good data science requires experts that combine substantive knowledge with data analytical skills, which makes it a prime area for social scientists with an interest in quantitative methods.

This course integrates prior training in quantitative methods (statistics) and coding with substantive expertise and introduces the fundamental concepts and techniques of Data Science and Big Data Analytics.

Typical students will be advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students from any field requiring the fundamentals of data science or working with typically large datasets and databases. Practitioners from industry, government, or research organisations with some basic training in quantitative analysis or computer programming are also welcome. Because this course surveys diverse techniques and methods, it makes an ideal foundation for more advanced or more specific training. Our applications are drawn from social, political, economic, legal, and business and marketing fields.

### Objectives

This course aims to provide an introduction to the data science approach to the quantitative analysis of data using the methods of statistical learning, an approach blending classical statistical methods with recent advances in computational and machine learning. We will cover the main analytical methods from this field with hands-on applications using example datasets, so that students gain experience with and confidence in using the methods we cover. We also cover data preparation and processing, including working with structured databases, key-value formatted data (JSON), and unstructured textual data. At the end of this course students will have a sound understanding of the field of data science, the ability to analyse data using some of its main methods, and a solid foundation for more advanced or more specialised study.  

The course will be delivered as a series of morning lectures, followed by lab sessions in the afternoon where students will apply the lessons in a series of instructor-guided exercises using data provided as part of the exercises. The course will cover the following topics:

- an overview of data science and the challenge of working with big data using statistical methods  
- how to integrate the insights from data analytics into knowledge generation and decision-making  
- how to acquire data, both structured and unstructured, and to process it, store it, and convert it into a format suitable for analysis  
- approaches to normalising data, using a database manager (SQLite), and working with SQL database queries  
- the basics of statistical inference including probability and probability distributions, modelling, experimental design  
- an overview of classification methods and related methods for assessing model fit and cross-validating predictive models  
- supervised learning approaches, including linear and logistic regression, decision trees, and na√Øve Bayes  
- unsupervised learning approaches, including clustering, association rules, and principal components analysis  
- quantitative methods of text analysis, including mining social media and other online resources  
- social network analysis, covering the basics of social graph data and analysing social networks  
- data visualisation through a variety of graphs.  


### Prerequisites

Students should already be familiar with quantitative methods at an introductory level, up to linear regression analysis. Familiarity with computer programming or database structures is a benefit, but not formally required.


### Preparing for the course

While we have also made a cloud server available to you for working with all of the assignments, if you want to use these locally or after the course, we recommend that you download and install [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com) on your computer.  

**Detailed instructions can also be found [here](https://lse-me314.github.io/instructions) for installing the tools you need and working with the lab materials.**

If you are not already familiar with R, we strongly encourage you to attempt to become familiar before the start of the course.  That way, you will spend much less time become familiar with the tools, and be able to focus more on the methods.  The following links provide a basic introduction to R, which you can study at your own pace before the course begins.

* [*An Introduction to R*](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf).
* Data Camp [R tutorials](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r).
* Data Camp [R Markdown tutorials](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/reporting-with-r-markdown), first chapter.
* [R Codeschool](http://tryr.codeschool.com/).

We strongly recommend you spend some of July and August before the course working through the following materials:

* Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham (2016) _R for Data Science_, O'Reilly Media. Note: Online version is available from the authors' page [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html).
* James et al. (2013) _An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With applications in R_, Springer, Chapters 1--2. Note: The book is available from the authors' page [here](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).

If you start preparing for the course (with the above materials) using your own laptop, it may be more convenient for you to continue using it during the summer school.

### Important Specifics

### Instructors

**Kenneth Benoit** is Professor of Quantitative Social Research Methods at the Department of Methodology, LSE. With a background in political science, his substantive work focuses on political party competition, political measurement issues, and electoral systems. His research and teaching is primarily in the field of social science statistical applications. His recent work concerns the quantitative analysis of text as data, for which he has developed a package for the R statistical software.


**Slava Jankin Mikhaylov** is Professor of Public Policy and Data Science at University of Essex, holding a joint appointment in Department of Government and School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering Institute for Analytics and Data Science (IADS). He serves as a Chief Scientific Adviser to Essex County Council. His current work focuses on embedding artificial intelligence and data science in public service delivery.

**Jack Blumenau** is a Lecturer in Quantitative Methods at the UCL Department of Political Science. he was previously an ESRC "Future Research Leader" post-doc in the Methodology Department at the LSE. His research explores the effects of legislative leaders on the behaviour of parliamentarians in the European Parliament and the UK House of Commons.

#### 2. The Shape of Data

This week introduces the concept of data "beyond the spreadsheet", the rectangular format most common in statistical datasets.  It covers relational structures and the concept of database normalization.  We will also cover ways to restructure data from "wide" to "long" format, within strictly rectangular data structures.  Additional topics concerning text encoding, date formats, and sparse matrix formats are also covered.
